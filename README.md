This is the repository for my final project in CS 351:01 - Web Development (10369) - Fall Semester 2024
This goal of this project is to create a functioning web application written with HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
The project utilizes Visual Studio Code, AMPPS, phpMyAdmin, and Github of course.

I did not correctly follow instructions, so I am documenting this here now. I used ChatGPT for a large majority of content in this project, and a little Copilot. Nearly all of the PHP code was written by Chat, and all of the JavaScript. Also helped troubleshoot a lot of the CSS.
